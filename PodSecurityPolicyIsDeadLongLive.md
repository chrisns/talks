# PodSecurityPolicy is Dead,<br/>Long Live...?

<!--
Hello! Imagine a thing with human faces, what a treat.
My name is Chris, and I've been trying to use Kubernetes since 0.4 and I'm a masochist, clearly.

I'm Solution Architect at Appvia, instructor at LearnK8s, and tinkerer of open source including maintaining some high profile open source projects.

I'm often told I talk too fast when doing these, please shout at me if this happens, and jump in with questions though there will hopefully be time at the end if I don't get covered in rotten tomatoes and booed off.

# PodSecurityWhat?

<!--
I'm going to talk a bit about pod security policies
-->

---

```yaml
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
```

<!--
They've been around since 1.0, which is about a million Kubernetes years.
-->

---

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
```

<!--
and in that time have never made it past the beta classification, and I believe one if not the last v1beta1 resources to be made real like ingress was not long ago maturing into a v1 resource
-->

---

# üò¢ <!--fit-->

<!--
Sadly that's not the case for PSPs, they were deprecated in 1.21 April last year, and will be removed entirely in 1.25 which will be around April this year.

# What is a PSP?

Pod Security Policies enable fine-grained authorization of pod creation and updates.

A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls security sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system, as well as defaults for the related fields.

# What is a PSP?

Pod Security Policies enable **fine-grained authorization** of pod **creation** and **updates**.

A Pod Security Policy is a **cluster-level** resource that controls security sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system, as well as defaults for the related fields.

<!--
Thats better
PSPs give cluster admins an ability to impose limits over things like running as root, opening ports on the host, types of volume you can use etc
-->

apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: example

# üëç <!--fit-->

<!--
Sounds like a great idea right?
-->

# ‚úã <!--fit-->

<!--
Not so fast bucko!
Theres a whole heap of usability issues you might have encountered if you'd tried to use them.
-->

---

![bg](./images/binding.jpeg)

<!--
The policy is based on the user that created the pod, not the workload.
If you're creating pods with CI for example that might require you to have multiple identities to authenticate to the API server with
But when was the last time you created a pod and not a deployment, statefulset or whatever else, well in that case the identity creating the pod is the service account for that controller
-->

---

![bg](./images/mutating.jpeg)

<!--
Some of the parameters aren't simply admission controllers that accept or reject but mutating, this is not clear
-->

<!--
The of order of evaluation can be confusing and unpredictable with multiple policies

Only applies to new pods, not to anything already running in the cluster, which means you might not know if you introduce a policy if it breaks your production apps until they happen to try to reschedule and fail.

So what are the alternatives, what should we do

<!--
I'm going to focus on a few, because with a little help they provide a straight forward-ish migration journey
-->

---

# Wait, what about </br>Pod Security Standards </br>and the</br> Pod Security Admission?

<!--
There is an 'in tree' answer i.e. built in to Kubernetes, so why am I not going to just point at that, grab my drink and walk off.
Pod Security Standards are most easily thought of as three rigidly defined predefined Pod Security Policies
-->

---

# Privileged

<!--
Those are privileged, basically anything goes, and is the same as not defining a policy
-->

---

# Baseline

<!--
Baseline, middle ground, stops some of the super obvious stuff, most your stuff should run at this tier without change
-->

---

# Restricted

<!--
Restricted, The most restrictive policy, stops most things.
You should aspire to run stuff here, but realistically you'll probably have issues
-->

---

# üòÄ <!--fit-->

<!--
Rigid universal policies sounds great, its super easy to communicate these between teams, test against them and no confusion when deploying between different clusters, happy days right?
-->

---

# ‚òπÔ∏è <!--fit-->

<!--
Sadly not, for a few reasons
Ideally you'd run all your workload at restricted, but inevitably there'll be some things that can't quite fit that
Well restrictions are applied on a namespace level
And theres no way to grant fine grained exemptions, so your only option is to take a massive step down, and not for just the container but whole namespace
-->

---

# üò± <!--fit-->

<!--
Oh, and its applied with a label on the namespace, not even an annotation
WTF guys?!
So what's it good for, well the only thing I can see this as possibly good for is if you're a Software Vendor building products to run on Kubernetes.
-->

---

# üòú <!--fit-->

<!--
And if you're mad enough to be in that business
-->

---

# üåü <!--fit-->

<!--
If you can make your product run in restricted then it'll give you a good head start for whatever unique configuration your customers have implemented and demonstrate that you have considered the security implications of your product
-->

---

# üßìüë¥ <!--fit-->

<!--
Ok so how do we migrate all our old legacy PSPs to something new
Well there is unfortunately no simple like-for-like mapping, PodSecurityPolicy and any of the replacements behave slightly differently, and for good reason too.

If you‚Äôve been using PodSecurityPolicy for a while, you‚Äôve likely developed some quite complex rules which have become entangled with the usability issues, so I would encourage you to take the opportunity to refactor and simplify over trying to continue what you‚Äôve always done.

That said, there has been some work to ease the transition by reproducing the key capabilities and even calling them the same things in some cases.

# But, should you migrate from PodSecurityPolicy?

<!--
But should you?
Don't be fooled, just because I wrote a tool to help does not mean I think any of this is even remotely a good idea for the vast majority of use cases.

But it got your attention, now let me bend your ear.
-->

---

# üö´ <!--fit-->

<!--
Using a cluster enforced policy does not guaranty any real security, and its hard to know the effectiveness of policy without constantly monitoring the impact it is having, by seeing how many requests are being rejected.
-->

---

# üóù <!--fit-->

<!--
The key to making this succeed is for all the stakeholders to understand the need, why their thing is being rejected
-->

---

# üßôüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏èüë©‚ÄçüöÄüë©‚Äçüöíüßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è</br>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë©‚ÄçüåæüíÇ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë≥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßïüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <!--fit-->

<!--
Imagine a problem that can't just be solved with a tools and requires you to focus on the people and process first. Shocking right?!
-->

---

# Shift ‚¨ÖÔ∏è <!--fit-->

<!--
We should always be thinking about shifting the process to the left so issues are caught as early as possible. Using cluster enforced policy alone does not help, the request to create the resource has to reach the API server, be authenticated and authorised before it is rejected/accepted. In order to get to that point the request would have gone through pipelines to be deployed and if the request is rejected valuable time and resources will have been wasted.

This is further exacerbated if your cluster enforced policy is based on the pod, since your deployment/daemonset/statefulset/job/crd/etc would be accepted by the API server and policy, but the pods it tries to create would be rejected within the internal loops within the controller or other operators present on the cluster.

Kubernetes is already complex enough, adding policies to the cluster adds another layer of complexity that needs to be managed, maintained and documented to ensure smooth operation of your cluster.

I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt have policies and security controls; but it‚Äôs too easy to get carried away and reinvent all the painful bureaucracy that ‚Äòdevops‚Äô promised we wouldn‚Äôt have to endure.
-->

---

# GitOps? <!--fit-->

<!--
If you‚Äôre doing GitOps and you absolutely should be then the only thing that can make changes to your cluster is the CI pipeline, and if it‚Äôs not you must accept drift will occur.

The consequence of policy being evaluated and enforced in the cluster is you‚Äôve committed the cardinal sin of devops on accident by shifting all that responsibility right and making it harder to observe.

You‚Äôll likely have broken master branches, thrashing rework, lots of pull requests with the titles like ‚Äúfixing policy fail‚Äù, a necessity for access to be granted to the upstream cluster  among other things.

Basically all the stuff you were promised was left behind in the past has come back to haunt you.
-->

---

# Cut to the chase Chris,</br>What‚Äôs the answer? <!--fit-->

<!--
Cluster policy is fine but failures should cause alerts you‚Äôd be glad to be awoken at 3am to deal with.

They should represent genuine incidents, not just a developer trying to do their job.
-->

---

# as-code<!--fit-->

<!--
Infrastructure as Code is the answer for this all. Developers who write code solved this problem a long time ago with linters and static analysis, and they have a passion for running these FAST, and consistently, in their IDE, and then in CI before any pull request review occurs which assures that the teams code all looks similar and conforms to some mutually agreed standards the team develops.
-->

---

![bg](./images/insurance-policy.jpeg)

<!--
You can have as many policies you like as long as these policies are treated as code, committed into source control and versioned accordingly. This will give you a complete view of the policies in use in your cluster at any point in time and help understand the risk landscape, target what workloads should be supported and when you should stop supporting a given policy version.
-->

---

![bg](./images/devlaptop.jpeg)

<!--
The key thing is that your developers should be able to evaluate against that policy locally, maybe even within their editor and your CI pipeline and version control can enforce compliance.

Your cluster level policy failures should then be limited to real fires where something has gone drastically wrong and a 3am call will cause warranted panic and gratitude for the policy‚Äôs existence.
-->

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏èüëÄ <!--fit-->

<!--
If you‚Äôre going to turn on warnings rather than just rejections, be sure someone will see them, if your gitops is even vaguely real, that won‚Äôt be a human in the first instance, so your teams will need to get that in front of them somehow; otherwise what‚Äôs the point?
-->

---

![bg](./images/mindthegap.jpeg)

<!--
Some would argue that setting cluster policy is at the point of execution, the last protection as it were.
But when we actually look at the mechanics, the checks are run on the control plane, the worker node and container runtime is not checking anything, it is trusting the word of api server with its limited capability to carry out checks, wow, you couldn‚Äôt get further from zero trust could you.
-->

---

# Trusted<br/>!=<br/>Trustworthy <!--fit-->

<!--
So how can you get closer to that zero trust nirvana?
Fortunately the linux kernel, the same marvel that brings us containers, provides a few capabilities for this.

<!--
However, managing them is not easy, so unsurprisingly lots of commercial products have entered the space with all sorts of buzzwords like ‚Äòartificial intelligence‚Äô and ‚Äòmachine learning‚Äô.

These commercial offerings are great and can simplify the implementation but it‚Äôs worth understanding how things are working under the hood and electing how much control you might relinquish to an algorithm.

<!--
Relatively recently a Kubernetes special interest group has developed the Security Profiles Operator which works to expose the power of seccomp, SELinux and AppArmor to end users.

The technologies are not mutually exclusive, and I would encourage combining them.

In fact its worth noting that seccomp even the default policy would mitigate some recent high profile vulnerabilities like Polkit's Pwnkit that any cluster admission policy would have waved through.
